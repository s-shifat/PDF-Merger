This is a very simple gui program to merge two or more 
pdf files into one.<br>
You can directly download and use the `merger_gui.exe` from [dist folder](https://github.com/s-shifat/mrg-pdf/tree/main/dist) <br>
Nothing else is needed to be downloaded. <br>
If you want, feel free to clone the repository to modify the source code.
