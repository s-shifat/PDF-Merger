# PDF Merger

This is a very simple gui program to merge two or more 
pdf files into one.<br>
- You can directly download and use the `merger_gui.exe` from directory [dist](https://github.com/s-shifat/mrg-pdf/tree/main/dist) <br> 
  Nothing else is needed to be downloaded. <br>
- I have also provided two sample pdfs in directory [samples](https://github.com/s-shifat/mrg-pdf/tree/main/samples) <br>
###### Also if you need, feel free to clone the repository to modify the source code.
